Using this docker-file you could spawn up your own wondercms-instance for experimenting.
Note that this uses outdated/vulnerable versions of php and wondercms and should not be used in production.
Do not expose it to untrusted networks! Do not make it publicly available!

Use at your own risk.

```
# create the container-image
docker build -t wondercms .
# run the container
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80 --name sea-wondercms wondercms
```
